## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)

1.	Sort flights to find the fastest flights
```
```{r}
flights %>% mutate(travel_time = ifelse((arr_time - dep_time < 0), 
                                        2400+(arr_time - dep_time),
                                        arr_time - dep_time)) %>% 
  arrange(travel_time) %>% select(arr_time, dep_time, travel_time)

arrange(flights, (arr_time - dep_time))
```
2.	Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate (dep_time = (dep_time %/% 100) * 60 + (dep_time %% 100),
         sched_dep_time = (sched_dep_time %/% 100) * 60 + (sched_dep_time %% 100),
         arr_time = (arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + (arr_time %% 100),
         sched_arr_time = (sched_arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + (sched_arr_time %% 100)) %>%
  transmute (near((sched_dep_time + dep_delay) %% (60*24), dep_time, tol=1))


```
3.	Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
a.	A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
b.	A flight is always 10 minutes late.
c.	A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
d.	99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.

Answer:

```{r}
str(flights)
head(flights)
flight_delay_summary <- group_by(flights, flight) %>% summarise(num_flights = n(),
                                                                percentage_on_time = sum(arr_time == sched_arr_time)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_early = sum(arr_time < sched_arr_time)/num_flights, 
                                                                percentage_15_mins_early = sum(sched_arr_time - arr_time == 15)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_late = sum(arr_time > sched_arr_time)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_15_mins_late = sum(arr_time - sched_arr_time == 15)/num_flights,
                                                                percentage_2_hours_late = sum(arr_time - sched_arr_time == 120)/num_flights)


```
4.	Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?

Answer:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(prop_on_time = sum(arr_delay <= 30 & !is.na(arr_delay))/n(),
            mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm=TRUE),
            flights = n()) %>%
  arrange(prop_on_time, desc(mean_arr_delay))
flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  filter(all(is.na(arr_delay))) %>%
    tally(sort=TRUE)	
```
5.	Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.


Answer:

```{r}
select(flights, dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, c(dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay))
flights %>% select(dep_time,  dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
flights %>% select_("dep_time",  "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
flights %>% select_(.dots=c("dep_time",  "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay"))
# fancier ways
flights %>% select(dep_time:arr_delay, -c(contains("sched")))
flights %>% select(ends_with("time"),  ends_with("delay")) %>% select(-c(starts_with("sched"), starts_with("air")))
flights %>% select(contains("dep"), contains("arr"), -contains("sched"), -carrier)
flights %>% select(matches("^dep|arr_delay|time$"))
flights %>% select(matches("^dep|^arr"))
flights %>% select(matches("^dep|^arr.*time$|delay$"))
flights %>% select(matches("^dep|^arr_time$|delay$"))
```
